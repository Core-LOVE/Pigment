Pigment is a Fabric/Quilt mod that adds new colored blocks. Currently it adds:
* Terracotta Bricks
* Terracotta Shingles
* Concrete Bricks
* Patterned Wool (+ Carpets)
## Forge/NeoForge Port
Personally I don't plan to do port to other loaders, but I'm not against "unofficial" ports.
## Backports
I plan to do 1.20.1 (and maybe even 1.19.x backports). My mod doesn't really add anything special code-wise, but I still would be glad to see any form of contribution!
## Translations
Currently mod supports EN (US). If you are willing to translate my mod, feel free to fork repo and pull request!
